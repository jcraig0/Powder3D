# Powder3D 0.1.0

This is a demo version of a three-dimensional falling sand game, made with the Unity engine. The player can select from seven elements with varying states and behaviors: Wall, Powder, Water, Gas, Fire, Light, and Clone.

The game was inspired by [The Powder Toy](https://github.com/The-Powder-Toy/The-Powder-Toy), created by Stanislaw Skowronek. The behavior for the Powder and Water elements mostly comes from [Sandspiel](https://github.com/maxbittker/sandspiel), by Max Bittker.
